-`♡´- Please be kind and don't pull me into drama! 

-`♡´- I play Pony Town for personal enjoyment and for fun in my free time. 

-`♡´- sometimes I might be AFK in the game, as sometimes I like to draw while I'm chilling in game! so feel free to whisper to me if i'm AFK.

ִֶָ☾. Hello, my name is Corvin, but you can call me Eridan or whatever I'm cosplaying on Pony Town in the moment. :) ִֶָ☾. 

࣪ ִֶָ☾. C+H - w2int/whisper to interact if I don't respond - ask B4 adding, i'm uncomfortable with being friends on media with anyone below the age of 16. ( im okay with interactions on pony town only, just no friend requests please if under 16.) ִֶָ☾.

࣪ ִֶָ☾. Feel free to ask me via whisper for my socials (i'm most active on Discord.), i may say no depending on how much we've actually talked in game. ִֶָ☾. 

࣪ ִֶָ☾. ࣪I block/hide freely/if i'm uncomfortable with an interaction. ִֶָ☾. 

࣪ ִֶָ☾. ࣪Don't expect me to respond to everything, i'm really shy and socially awkward and anxious at times so i appreciate when people are patient with me when it comes to me responding or whisper chat with me instead because its more comfortable for me in those moments. :) ִֶָ☾. 

࣪ ִֶָ☾. ࣪Please don't copy any of my ponies, inspo is genuinely okay but don't full on copy my entire pony please <3 ִֶָ☾.
