-`♡´- Please be kind and don't pull me into drama! 

-`♡´- I play Pony Town for personal enjoyment and for fun in my free time. 

-`♡´- sometimes I might be AFK in the game, as sometimes I like to draw while I'm chilling in game! so feel free to whisper to me if i'm AFK. 

-`♡´- **I AM 18,  PLEASE DON'T ASK FOR MY SOCIALS IF YOU ARE UNDER 16!!**

(♡ˊ͈ ꒳ ˋ͈) Feel free to ask me things about myself if you want to get to know me better !

࣪ ִֶָ☾. Please tell me your age before giving out socials, i am 18 and i am uncomfortable with being friends with those under the age of 16. **(in pony-town i don't mind being friends / interacting with anyone IN GAME just for brief chatting + cosplaying in game, i just don't want to be interacting with you outside of pony town / media other than pony-town if you're under 16.)** ִֶָ☾.
